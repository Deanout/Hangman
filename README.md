# Hangman
Repository for CSE337's hangman prerequisite assignment.

Created as close to the original homework specifications as possible.
This should not be considered a reflection of front end design capabilities,
merely a demonstration of my ability to implement a basic hangman game in Java.

Feel free to use this code for whatever suits your needs.

Cheers.
